## Short description ##
**ting** was started as a simple cross platform C++ wrapper for threading (thread, mutex, semaphore, message queue and message). But now **ting** is not only a threading library, now it is a utility framework containing also Network Sockets API library and some other useful stuff, e.g. reference counted pointers etc. See [WiKi page](MainPage.md) for what is there.

**ting** stands for ThreadING
